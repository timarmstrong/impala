# When installing the python shell as a standalone package, this __init__ is
# used to workaround the issues stemming from IMPALA-6808. Because of the way
# the Impala python environment has been somewhat haphazardly constructed in
# a deployed cluster, it ends up being "polluted" with top-level modules that
# should really be sub-modules. One of the principal places this occurs is with
# the various modules required by the Impala shell. This isn't a concern when
# the shell is invoked via a specially installed version of python that belongs
# to Impala, but it does become an issue when the shell is being run using the
# system python.
#
# If we want to install the shell as a standalone package, we need to construct
# it in such a way that all of the internal modules are contained within a
# top-level impala_shell namespace. However, this then breaks various imports
# throughout the Impala shell code. The way this file corrects that is to add
# the impala_shell directory to PYTHONPATH only when the shell is invoked. As
# far as I can tell, there's no cleaner way to address this without fully
# resolving IMPALA-6808.
